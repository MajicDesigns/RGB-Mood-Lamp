# RGB_Mood_Lamp

Sketch that uses the properties of the RGB Colour Cube to transition between colours.

The RGB colour space can be viewed as a cube of colour. If we assume a cube of dimension 1, then the coordinates of the vertices for the cube will range from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1) (all black to all white).

The transitions between each vertex will be a smooth colour flow and we can exploit this by using the path coordinates as the LED transition effect.
